# Task 1

Count the minimum number of coins that must be reversed to have all the coins lying on the same side.
There are N coins, each showing either heads or tails. We would like all the coins to show the same face. What is the minimum number of coins that
must be reversed?

Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the minimum number of coins that must be reversed.
Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins and contain only a 0 (heads) or a 1 (tails).

For example, given array A = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], there are four coins showing heads and two coins showing tails. The function should return 2, as after
reversing two coins (in positions 0 and 3), all the coins will be showing the same face (heads).

Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [1..100];
each element of array A is an integer that can have one of the following values: 0, 1.
